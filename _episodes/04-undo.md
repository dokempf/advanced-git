## Git Revert

Reverting undoes a commit by creating a new commit. This is a safe way to undo changes, as it has no chance of re-writing the commit history. For example, the following command will figure out the changes contained in the 2nd to last commit, create a new commit undoing those changes, and tack the new commit onto the existing project.

~~~
git revert HEAD~1
ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

![GitFlow 1](../fig/08-revert.png)

Note that revert only backs out the atomic changes of the ONE specific commit (by default, you can also give it a range of commits but we are not going to do that here, see the help).

`git revert` does not rewrite history which is why it is the preferred way of dealing with issues when the changes have already been pushed to a remote repository.

## Git Reset

Resetting is a way to move the tip of a branch to a different commit. This can be used to remove commits from the current branch. For example, the following command moves the `hotfix` branch backwards by two commits.

~~~
git checkout hotfix
git reset HEAD~1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

![GitFlow 1](../fig/07-reset.png)


The two commits that were on the end of `hotfix` are now dangling, or orphaned commits. This means they will be deleted the next time `git` performs a garbage collection. In other words, you’re saying that you want to throw away these commits.

`git reset` also reverts the commits but leaves the uncommitted changes in the repo.

~~~
git status
git restore b.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

`git reset` is a simple way to undo changes that haven’t been shared with anyone else. It’s your go-to command when you’ve started working on a feature and find yourself thinking, “Oh crap, what am I doing? I should just start over.”

In addition to moving the current branch, you can also get `git reset` to alter the staged snapshot and/or the working directory by passing it one of the following flags:

__--soft__ – The staged snapshot and working directory are not altered in any way.

__--mixed__ – The staged snapshot is updated to match the specified commit, but the working directory is not affected. __This is the default option__.

__--hard__ – The staged snapshot and the working directory are both updated to match the specified commit.

It’s easier to think of these modes as defining the scope of a git reset operation.

To just undo any uncommitted changes:

~~~
git status
git add c.txt
git status
git reset HEAD
git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You can add and commit the changes or restore the file.

`git reset` can also work on a single file:

~~~
git reset HEAD~2 foo.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

## Git Checkout: A Gentle Way

We already saw that `git checkout` is used to move to a different branch but is can also be used to update the state of the repository to a specific point in the projects history.

~~~
git checkout hotfix
git checkout HEAD~2
~~~
{: .language-bash}

![GitFlow 1](../fig/09-checkout.png)

This puts you in a detached HEAD state. AGHRRR!

Most of the time, HEAD points to a branch name. When you add a new commit, your branch reference is updated to point to it, but HEAD remains the same. When you change branches, HEAD is updated to point to the branch you’ve switched to. All of that means that, in these scenarios, HEAD is synonymous with “the last commit in the current branch.” This is the normal state, in which HEAD is attached to a branch.

The detached HEAD state is when HEAD is pointing directly to a commit instead of a branch. This is really useful because it allows you to go to a previous point in the project’s history. You can also make changes here and see how they affect the project.

~~~
echo "Welcome to the alternate timeline, Morty!" > new-file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Create new file"
echo "Another line" >> new-file.txt
git commit -a -m "Add a new line to the file"
git log --oneline
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you haven't made any changes or you have made changes but you want to discard them you can recover by switching back to your branch:

~~~
git checkout hotfix
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Alternatively, you want to keep the changes:

~~~
git branch alt-history
git checkout alt-history
~~~
{: .language-bash}
